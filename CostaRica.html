<h2>Costa Rica</h2>
<h3>Thankful</h3>
<p>I am a firm believer of everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>If you follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/favthingsnet/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, you are probably aware I went on a last minute trip traveling alone to Costa Rica without knowing any Spanish (or where Costa Rica is, tbh). This trip happened on so many levels that I did not expect, and I felt as if I came back to New York City a new person.</p>
<p>Since today is still technically Thanksgiving week, I want to give thanks to the people and things I met on this trip full of breakthroughs and craziness (in reverse chronicle order):<span id="more-53"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. LA guy assigned to sit next to me on the bus to the airport. Of all the chances we could&#8217;ve crossed paths, I am thankful we met on <em>this</em> bus ride, shared our special feelings we had about this trip, and the music that concluded Costa Rica.</li>
<li>Bar staff at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BarAmigosMonteverde" target="_blank">Bar Amigos</a> feeding me ceviche &amp; guaro! Also our brief exchange of conversation in body language and &#8216;Bueno? Bueno!&#8217;</li>
<li>Owner at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BesoEspresso/" target="_blank">Beso Espresso</a> and the two baristas named Maria(s). Thanks for listening to my crazy Costa Rica travel stories when I needed to share those feelings after the Tarzan swing, advising me against a (maybe) dangerous spot, and then gave me a free brownie to compensate for it.</li>
<li>Staff of <a href="http://www.aventuracanopytour.com/" target="_blank">100% Aventura</a> at the end of the <a href="https://youtu.be/FoUl1wiO98Y" target="_blank">Tarzan swing</a> bridge, for not letting me say no and pushing me off the bridge &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t have done it without you two, literally.</li>
<li>French lady at the Britt coffee farm tour for letting me, a stranger, put my bag of souvenirs in your hotel room, explore downtown San Jose with me, and shared with me the French way of living/eating.</li>
<li>Multiple different people on different buses who helped me get off the right stop &#8211; in English and in body language.</li>
<li>Dylan &amp; Luigi. Thank you so much for opening your home to host couchsurfers! Especially Luigi &#8211; for telling me casado means &#8216;married&#8217;. I am still showing off my new-found knowledge of Costa Rican culture. :p</li>
<li>Chelsea from New Orleans. Thank you for sharing your car and your story with me. I wouldn&#8217;t have gone to Monteverde if it wasn&#8217;t for you raging about it. And thanks for having my back when I was about to break down. You go girl üíõ</li>
<li>Couple from LA on Manuel Antonio beach and the three Imperial beers you shared with me after knowing I&#8217;m 23 and traveling alone, aka broke.</li>
<li>Guy in coconut tree letting me try on the coconut oil he makes from the fresh coconuts.</li>
<li>Mama Tica sharing a slice of watermelon with me and watching my bag while I play in the water. Me no Espa√±ol y you no Ingl√©s, and it still worked. üëç</li>
<li>Local worker on the beach teaching me how to drink iced tea out of a plastic bag. (Bite off the corner and squeeze it in your mouth, FYI.)</li>
<li>Couple on the boat tour for letting me join you two into the national park and saw sloths together.</li>
<li>Evan. Man, whatever you&#8217;ve gone through in your life, it all happened for a reason &#8211; which is bringing you to Manuel Antonio and saving my gringo ass. #casadochangeslife</li>
<li>Korean couple from San Jose hostel sharing a cab with me to the bus terminal. 2000 colones saved. #kaching</li>
<li>Staff at <a href="http://www.hostelurbano.com/" target="_blank">Hostel Urbano</a> for your patience helping me navigate Costa Rica and figure my trip out.</li>
<li>Zach, literally saving me in the middle of cultural shock on day one and made me felt that much better about traveling alone in Costa Rica speaking no Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything happened for a reason. And the only variable you can control is to make the decision of traveling alone.</p>
<p>Just trust me on this one.</p>
