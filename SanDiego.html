<h2>San Diego</h2>
<h3>Spending six weeks after graduation before beginning of 'real world' in America's Finest.</h3>
<p>With my student visa status, I was able to participate in a travel volunteer program by <a href="www.usahostels.com/locations/san-diego/">USA Hostels</a>. For six weeks, I worked at the hostel 4 hours a day, 6 days a week, in exchange to live in the hostel for free. During the time, I met travelers, fellow volunteers, full time staff of the hostel, and had the best time of my life.</p>
<p>There were so much to be remembered, but San Diego turned me from an overly city girl who never hiked nor stop and enjoy nature, to an outdoor girl who just want to lay on the beach and listen to the ocean all day. San Diego is now my retirement goal - buying a mansion on top of the cliff in La Jolla sounds nice, isn't it?</p>

<p>My fellow volunteers during my stay there. Words can't explain how much we were happy to have each other and be in the experience together. A song would have to do for now.</p>
